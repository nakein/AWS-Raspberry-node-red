## Cloud Computing and Cloud Robotics

In "cloud computing and cloud robotics" we did five proyects.

## Proyect 1: 
Learn how to use aws to create instances. We had to realize the connetion via ssh, config the security group, reserve an elastic ip and asociate it with the instace created.

## Proyect 2: 
Learn how to use node red, applying the knowledge acquired in Proyect 1. We had to create 2 instances and install node-red on both. With this, we had to communicate between instances via MQTT using the AWS IoT broker.

## Proyect 3: 
Using "Home I/O" and node-red, we had to turn "Home I/O" into a smart house, the following interface shows the sliders to turn on the lights and open or close the blinds

## Proyect 4: 
Learn how to use a raspberry pi with node red, and connect peripherals to it. With an ultrasound sensor, movement sensor and led lights, we had to simulate a real life problem. Our group did an "Security system", when the movement sensor detects something, activates the ultrasound sensor to know how far is, and depending on the distance the led lights will turn on (Green if nearby, Yellow if medium distance, Red if far). The interface shows if there is movement and the distance.

## Last Proyect: 
The problem was to carry out the remote control of an unmanned vehicle and use the previous peripherals.
